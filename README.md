# Solver tests for MOI

This packages is used to tests solver implemented the [MathOptInterface](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/MathOptInterface.jl).
The tests on Travis: [![][build-img]][build-url]

We test all solvers in the [list of supported solvers](https://www.juliaopt.org/JuMP.jl/dev/installation/#Getting-Solvers-1)
that can be tested on Travis (e.g. some proprietary solvers cannot be tested on Travis unless special support is provided).
